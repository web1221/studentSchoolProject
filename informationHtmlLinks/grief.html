                    Many people are experiencing grief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Grief is a natural reaction to loss that occurs during or after a disaster or other traumatic event. Grief can occur as a result of the loss of a loved one, as well as drastic changes in daily routines and ways of life that normally provide us with comfort and a sense of stability.

                            <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px;">“Some people may experience multiple losses during a disaster or large-scale emergency event. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, you might be unable to be with a loved one when they die, or unable to mourn someone’s death in-person with friends and family. Other types of loss include unemployment, or not making enough money, loss or reduction in support services, and other changes in your lifestyle. These losses can happen at the same time, which can complicate or prolonged grief and delay a person’s ability to adapt, heal, and recover.”</p>
