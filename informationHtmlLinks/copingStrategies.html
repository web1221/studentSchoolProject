            <li class="list-group-item text-center"> <b>Get enough sleep.</b> Go to bed and get up at the same times each day. Stick close to your typical schedule, even if you're staying at home. </li>
            <li class="list-group-item text-center"><b>Participate in regular physical activity.</b> Regular physical activity and exercise can help reduce anxiety and improve mood. Find an activity that includes movement, such as dance or exercise apps. Get outside in an area that makes it easy to maintain distance from people, such as a nature trail or your own backyard.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item text-center"><b>Eat healthy.</b> Choose a well-balanced diet. Avoid loading up on junk food and refined sugar. Limit caffeine as it can aggravate stress and anxiety.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item text-center"><b>Avoid tobacco, alcohol and drugs.</b> If you smoke tobacco or if you vape, you're already at higher risk of lung disease. Because COVID-19 affects the lungs, your risk increases even more. Using alcohol to try to cope can make matters worse and reduce your coping skills. Avoid taking drugs to cope, unless your doctor prescribed medications for you.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item text-center"><b>Limit screen time.</b> Turn off electronic devices for some time each day, including 30 minutes before bedtime. Make a conscious effort to spend less time in front of a screen — television, tablet, computer and phone.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item text-center"><b>Relax and recharge. Set aside time for yourself.</b> Even a few minutes of quiet time can be refreshing and help to quiet your mind and reduce anxiety. Many people benefit from practices such as deep breathing, tai chi, yoga or meditation. Soak in a bubble bath, listen to music, or read or listen to a book — whatever helps you relax. Select a technique that works for you and practice it regularly.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item text-center"><b>Keep your regular routine.</b> Maintaining a regular schedule is important to your mental health. In addition to sticking to a regular bedtime routine, keep consistent times for meals, bathing and getting dressed, work or study schedules, and exercise. Also set aside time for activities you enjoy. This predictability can make you feel more in control.</li>
