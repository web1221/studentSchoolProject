Many of us are confronted with difficulties that can be stressful, overwhelming, and elicit strong emotions in both adults and children. Prevention efforts, such as social distancing, are necessary to limit the growth of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated and lonely, as well as increase stress and anxiety.
