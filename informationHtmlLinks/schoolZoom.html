                    Covid has undone months of academic gains, leaving many students behind. Of course, the idea that students forget some of what they learned in school over the summer isn't new. But there's a big difference between summer learning loss and pandemic-related learning loss. Researchers predict that, on average, students will experience substantial drops in reading and math, losing roughly three months' worth of gains in reading and five months' worth of gains in math. When schools reopen, many students may be behind, compared to a typical school year, so teachers will need to be very methodical about checking in on their students. Many children who return to school will be lonely, having been isolated for months. Many who remain at home will feel even lonelier and more isolated as they see members of their peer group out and about.  Loneliness can translate to poor sleep, high blood pressure, greater risk of suicidal ideation, and even alcohol and drug use. Depression, anxiety, and fear can also increase.

                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Video calls can be intimidating (and energy-draining) for a lot of people, especially those who have anxiety. In COVID-19 times, a lot of interaction is happening over video and sometimes there’s no way around it – you just have to show up for classes, meetings, or appointments. If you’re in therapy, sessions may seem more burdensome than usual right now; if you don’t have a therapist but want one, having to start with virtual therapy might be scaring you off. It’s a catch-22 – therapy can help reduce your anxiety, but it might also cause some anxiety, at least early on.” It’s not just in your head – Zoom/video fatigue is real. Video calls require more focus than in-person conversations because you are trying to process nonverbal cues through a screen. Paying close attention to these takes up a lot of energy, and your energy levels are probably already lower than usual because of pandemic-related stress.</p>
