                In today's world, there is a lot going on. People are still becoming ill because of COVID-19, natural disasters continue to strike parts of the United States, and racist incidents are in the news almost every day. All of these things can have direct (and indirect) effects on our lives, and it's easy to feel as if we're always on the lookout for "the next bad thing." This fear and anxiety can be debilitating, making everything appear hopeless.
